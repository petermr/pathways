EGCG has been extensively investigated as a multi-targeting anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory compound. In this study, we demonstrated a novel mechanism by which EGCG reverses the neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells. We found that neutrophil elastase directly triggered human adenocarcinoma A549 cell migration and that EGCG suppressed the elevation of tumor cell migration induced by neutrophil elastase. We observed that EGCG directly binds to neutrophil elastase and inhibits its enzymatic activity based on the CDOCKER algorithm, MD stimulation by GROMACS, SPR assay and elastase enzymatic activity assay. As the natural inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin is synthesized in tumor cells. We further demonstrated that the expression of &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin was up-regulated after EGCG treatment in neutrophil elastase-treated A549 cells. We preliminarily discovered that the EGCG-mediated induction of &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin expression might be correlated with the regulatory effect of EGCG on the PI3K/Akt pathway. Overall, our results suggest that EGCG ameliorates the neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells. The mechanism underlying this effect may include two processes: EGCG directly binds to neutrophil elastase and inhibits its enzymatic activity; EGCG enhances the expression of &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Of the wide variety of cancer types, lung cancer is the first and the second leading cause of cancer death globally in males and females, respectively.

Regarding its mechanisms of action, previous studies have shown that EGCG exerts its anti-tumor effects via the regulation of various protein kinases, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, especially Akt kinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. EGCG regulates various major signaling pathways, such as the activator protein (AP), nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), and phosphatidylinostitol&#x02013;3-OH kinase pathways (PI3K/Akt)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor metastatic properties of EGCG in the specific context of inflammation remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrated additional contributions of inflammation to the progression of lung cancer metastasis and a novel molecular target of EGCG, human neutrophil elastase, which induces lung cancer cell migration.</p><p>Neutrophils, as a component of the tumor microenvironment, have only recently been thought to play an important role in tumor growth and invasiveness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The presence of increased infiltrated neutrophils within tumors was significantly associated with a poorer clinical outcome in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Neutrophil elastase, which is released by activated neutrophils, is the most potent neutrophil protease. The potential substrates of this protease include cytokines and cytokine receptors, indicating that neutrophil elastase may regulate the inflammatory process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Recent reports have shown that neutrophil elastase directly induces uncontrolled tumor proliferation in a lung adenocarcinoma mouse model and in lung epithelial tumor cells.</p><p>Alpha-1 antitrypsin (&#x003b1;1-AT, AAT) is a serum glycoprotein that contains three potential glycosylation sites. As an acute-phase protein, AAT is thought to play an important role in limiting host tissue injury triggered by proteases, particularly human neutrophil elastase (HNE). The clinical relevance of AAT is demonstrated in individuals with an inherited deficiency in circulating AAT, who exhibit increased susceptibility to early-onset pulmonary emphysema and liver and pancreatic diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Neutrophil elastase and AAT are a protease and protease inhibitor counterpart pair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. It has been assumed that in AAT-deficiency, the protease/ anti-protease balance is shifted toward HNE, which leads to extensive tissue damage, particularly by causing emphysema.

The program was run using a Dell Optiplex755 server (Round Rock, TX). The CDOCKER algorithm employed a strategy involving the generation of the initial ligand orientation in the active site of the target protein followed by molecular dynamics (MD)-based simulated annealing and final refinement via energy minimization. The crystal structure of HNE (PDB ID: 2Z7F) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb</ext-link>). The water molecules in the protein were removed, the protein was refined based on the root mean square deviation (RMSD), and EGCG was docked to the protein according to the appropriate parameters. Beginning from the EGCG configuration, a set of 10 different orientations was randomly generated. The co-crystalized ligand SEI300 was used as the positive control ligand, and the binding site was defined based on the binding of SEI300 and HNE. The interaction energy was calculated to analyze the interaction between the ligand and the receptor. Once the ligand was docked to the active site, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed using the GROMACS 4.6.6 program. The GROMOS96 53a6 Force Field and the SPC/E water condition were selected during the topology process. Water was position-restrained using a force constant (kpr) of 1000&#x02009;kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;nm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. The protein was placed in the box at least 1.0&#x02009;nm from the box edge, and the box was defined as a cube. During the GENION process, 10&#x02009;Cl<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were added to the system for charge equilibration. A 30-ns MD simulation was performed. The GROMACS program was used to constrain the bonds involving hydrogen atoms, allowing for an integration interval of 2&#x02009;fs. The particle mesh Ewald method using a threshold of 1&#x02009;nm was employed to account for the electrostatic interactions. A threshold of 1&#x02009;4 nm was used for the van der Waals interactions. The non-bonded pair lists were updated every 0.010&#x02009;ps. The coordinates were saved every 1&#x02009;ps. Accuracy testing was performed by calculating the RMSD after re-docking the internal ligand to the protein using the algorithm.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Binding free energy calculations</title><p>The trajectories obtained from molecular dynamics were used for binding free energy calculations.

The results from the MTS proliferation assay showed that neutrophil elastase at a concentration of at least 20&#x02009;nM enhanced tumor cell viability; among all of the concentrations tested, 40&#x02009;nM neutrophil elastase displayed the strongest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus, we selected 10&#x02009;nM neutrophil elastase as the intervention condition. The MTS proliferation assay results showed similar cell viability between the control group and the groups treated with various concentrations of EGCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and also showed a non-significant change in cell viability between the group treated with neutrophil elastase (10&#x02009;nM) and the groups treated with EGCG and neutrophil elastase (10&#x02009;nM). However, in the wound healing assays, the cells treated with 10 or 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M EGCG migrated at a much slower rate than the control cells and the cells treated with neutrophil elastase (10&#x02009;nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>), suggesting that EGCG displays anti-migratory properties. To confirm this result, we performed further cell migration assays using the transwell chamber model. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>, the group treated with 10&#x02009;nM neutrophil elastase displayed significantly more migrating A549 cells than the control group. Alternatively, treatment with either 10 or 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M EGCG (after exposure to 10&#x02009;nM neutrophil elastase), resulted in dramatically fewer migrating A549 cells than the control treatment and treatment with neutrophil elastase (10&#x02009;nM) alone. These results indicated that treatment with EGCG at a concentration between 10 and 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M induces a substantial anti-migratory effect without affecting the proliferation of A549 cells exposed to neutrophil elastase.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>EGCG inhibits the HNE-induced regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers.</title><p>To determine whether EGCG regulates the HNE-induced EMT process, the expression of EMT marker proteins was detected via western blot assays and confocal microscopy. The results showed that vimentin expression was significantly altered after HNE treatment. However, as the specific inhibitor of HNE sivelestat sodium significantly up-regulated the expression of vimentin. Nevertheless, the vimentin protein levels were clearly down-regulated in response to EGCG treatment in the presence or absence of HNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). The expression of &#x003b2;-catenin was increased after HNE induction but was significantly decreased after treatment with 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol/L EGCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). We also detected the expression and sub-cellular localization of ZEB-1 because a recent study suggested that ZEB-1 plays a role in lung cancer invasiveness and metastasis development. The results showed that ZEB-1 expression was significantly increased after treatment with HNE, and this effect was ameliorated after the addition of EGCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, the sub-cellular translocation of ZEB-1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was detected after treatment with HNE. The expression of ZEB-1 in the nucleus was decreased after treatment with EGCG in the neutrophil elastase-treated A549 cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of the interaction between EGCG and HNE</title><p>We analyzed the binding pattern between EGCG and HNE. First, a crystal structure of HNE bound to a selective inhibitor (PDB ID: 2Z7F) was selected. The interaction energy between EGCG and HNE is &#x02013;29.9704&#x02009;kJ/mol, which is similar to the interaction energy (&#x02212;34.0679&#x02009;kJ/mol) between HNE and its endogenous inhibitor SEI300. The active binding site between EGCG and HNE (PDB ID: 2Z7F) was defined as the ligand-binding site with a 9-&#x000c5; radius. As anticipated, EGCG stably docked to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). At least 8 residues in the LBD were involved in the interaction between EGCG and the HNE protein. EGCG potentially formed hydrogen bonds with SER166, THR165, ARG217 and ARG178. Moreover, EGCG possessed a potential aromatic interaction with ARG177 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). The binding mode of EGCG in the LBD of HNE provided detailed structural insight into the interaction between this compound and the HNE protein. Furthermore, we performed a 30-ns MD process using GROMACS 4.6.6 software. The time-averaged normalized ratio of the gyration radius, the RMSD, hydrogen bonds and the GROMACS energy were analyzed to reflect the distribution of EGCG molecules surrounding HNE. The gyration radius and the RMSD of the ligand EGCG and the receptor HNE trended toward stability as time progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A,B</xref>). The interacting H-bond number was shown to change with in a stable range as time progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Additionally, the GROMACS energy did not fluctuate as time progressed changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>). g_mmpbsa method calculated results showed that &#x02206;<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>binding&#x02009;</italic></sub>=&#x02009;&#x02212;71.8 <inline-formula id="d33e497"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e498" xlink:href="srep11494-m13.jpg"/></inline-formula> 12.4.KJ/mol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The binding affinity of EGCG to HNE based on SPR biosensor analysis</title><p>To verify the prediction from the CDOCKER-based analysis that EGCG directly binds to the HNE protein, the binding affinity of EGCG to HNE was determined using SPR biosensor technology.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>, the RU increased with increasing EGCG concentration, indicating that EGCG bound to HNE in a concentration-dependent manner.

The results showed that HNE reacted with the substrate in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). After establishing the steady enzyme-substrate reaction system, we tested the inhibitory effect of EGCG at the indicated concentrations. Sivelestat sodium was used as the positive control to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EGCG.

Based on this understanding, we predominantly focused on the regulation of AAT by EGCG to investigate the mechanisms by which EGCG inhibits HNE-induced cell proliferation. Western blot assays were used to assess whether the AAT protein levels were altered by EGCG in A549 cells. When co-incubated with neutrophil elastase (10&#x02009;nM), EGCG (20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) enhanced AAT expression in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A,B</xref>).

EGCG suppresses proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by Toll-like receptor 9 agonists in prostate cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In addition, EGCG suppresses lung cancer cell growth via Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Many molecules are involved in the anti-tumor activity of EGCG, including JAK/STAT, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Wnt, Notch, NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Because cancer progression is a complex process, its pathogenic mechanism remains somewhat elusive. EGCG is considered as a natural multi-targeting chemopreventive agent. Thus, the possibility that EGCG inhibits tumor development via alternative mechanisms cannot be excluded. The purpose of this study was to investigate the novel inflammation-related mechanisms by which EGCG mediates anti-cancer migratory activity in lung cancer.</p><p>Recent studies suggested that chronic inflammatory pulmonary diseases such as emphysema are highly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, independent of smoking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. HNE, among the most potent proteinases released by neutrophils, is considered to be responsible for the elastolytic damage in emphysema<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. To some extent, neutrophil elastase may represent the link between emphysema and lung cancer. Recent reports showed that modest levels of neutrophil elastase led to the uncontrolled proliferation of A549 lung epithelial tumor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We found that HNE treatment (10&#x02009;nM) enhanced the migration of A549 cells. The concentrations of neutrophil elastase used in our study were lower than 40&#x02009;nM to avoid the proliferation-promoting effect of HNE. Our results indicated that 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M EGCG completely suppressed the enhancement of cell migration induced by HNE in A549 cells. Furthermore, we verified that EGCG ameliorated the neutrophil elastase-induced up-regulation of the expression of several EMT markers, such as ZEB-1 and vimentin. Notably, it was recently reported that tumor-entrained neutrophils (TENs) induced by a primary tumor accumulated in the circulation and the premetastatic lung and inhibited the metastatic seeding of tumor cells in the lungs by generating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in mouse models of breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Therefore, the role of HNE, which is generally considered as the major effector of human neutrophil function, particularly merits investigation. Thus, we provide the first evidence for the proliferation-promoting effect of HNE on A549 cells.</p><p>Next, we explored whether EGCG directly binds to HNE using the CDOCKER algorithm. CDOCKER is an efficient technique used to predict interactions between small molecules and proteins by modeling and RMSD analysis. The binding site was defined based on the definition of the positive control ligand (SEI300) binding site. The analysis showed that ARG A: 217 and THR A: 165 formed hydrogen bonds with the hydrogens on the phenolic hydroxyl groups of the small molecule EGCG. Additionally, ARG A: 177 formed a Pi bond with EGCG.</p><p>Applying minimization and MD to EGCG and HNE enabled us to perform a ligand-protein interaction analysis, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A&#x02013;D</xref>. To determine the specific binding site, we directly transformed the CDOCKER binding results in the PDB file to an MD preparation GRO file. This analysis showed that the interaction between EGCG and HNE may not involve instantaneous binding but rather may be a long term interaction. Based on the results of MD simulation, we further calculated the binding free energy. According to study of Sulea <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, we verified that EGCG could bind with HNE protein. To verify these results concerning the interaction between EGCG and HNE, we further evaluated the binding affinity of EGCG to HNE using SPR biosensor analysis. The results confirmed the computer modeling prediction. We are the first to discover this novel target of the multi-targeting molecule EGCG. Interestingly, the inhibitor of HNE sivelestat sodium displayed a lower affinity to HNE than EGCG. We found that the low water solubility of sivelestat sodium led to the appearance of the lipid solvent as an interfering factor. Because of equipment limitations, we could not resolve this issue in the present study. To confirm the inhibitory effect of the interaction between EGCG and neutrophil elastase on the activity of this enzyme, we measured the enzymatic activity of neutrophil elastase after treatment with EGCG or sivelestat sodium. Alasbahi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> had verified the method of the elastase enzymatic activity assay. EGCG exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of neutrophil elastase. As the positive control, sivelestat sodium exerted a greater inhibitory effect than EGCG.</p><p>As AAT is the specific and primary inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, we assumed that AAT might mediate the inhibitory effect of EGCG on neutrophil elastase-induced cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic>. AAT is predominantly synthesized in liver but is also expressed in extra-hepatic tissues and cells, including carcinoma cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The role of AAT in cancer development has been supported by some laboratory data; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of AAT in tumor cell migration is poorly understood. The primary function of AAT is the inhibition of neutrophil elastase. Our results indicated that the protein levels of AAT in A549 cells were clearly increased after treatment with EGCG. However, the contribution of AAT to the tumor development is somewhat controversial. In contrast to its effects against tumor growth, AAT has been shown to be correlated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and with the inhibitory effect of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) on the proliferation and invasiveness of lung cancer HCC cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Upon binding to neutrophil elastase, AAT activates cleavage within the reactive site loop (RSL) in a suicidal action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Evidence has indicated that the AAT levels are significantly elevated in the skin of NE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with NE<sup>+/+</sup> mice in a murine model of the autoimmune disease bullous pemphigoid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. It has been reported that the deficiency of circulating AAT is highly associated with lung inflammation and, especially, the early onset of pulmonary emphysema<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Additionally, clinical findings have indicated that AAT, which is elevated in the serum of cancer patients, is a serum biomarker for the diagnosis of lung cancer and prostate cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Previous studies showed that EGCG inhibits PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in various tumor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Our previous data demonstrated that the inhibition of neutrophil elastase-induced cell proliferation using curcumin (a type of polyphenol similar to EGCG) is also dependent on the PI3K pathway in A549 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Recently, it was shown that neutrophil elastase released by activated neutrophils within the lung is absorbed by adjacent epithelial tumor cells and degrades IRS-1, which is a binding partner of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, thereby inducing the hyperactivity of the PI3K pathway, which leads to uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Our results showed that the neutrophil elastase-induced decrease in IRS-1 expression was significantly inhibited by EGCG in A549 cells. The suppression of Akt and ERK1/2 has been thought to mediate the anti-tumor migration property of EGCG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Therefore, we explored whether EGCG treatment remarkably suppressed neutrophil elastase-induced phosphorylation and activation of PI3K/Akt. Our results showed that the expression of Ser473-phosphorylated Akt was increased in neutrophil elastase-induced A549 cells and was down-regulated after co-treatment with EGCG and neutrophil elastase. Moreover, we observed the phosphorylation of Akt at Thy308. Compared with the regulation of Ser473 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation state of Thy308 was not significantly changed after treatment with neutrophil elastase. These results indicated that the migration-promoting effect of neutrophil elastase was not mediated by Akt phosphorylation at Thy308 but might be mediated by the regulation of p473-Akt. In the positive control group, neither p308-Akt nor p473-Akt expression was significantly changed after treatment with the inhibitor of neutrophil elastase sivelestat sodium. We speculated that sivelestat sodium, as a selective neutrophil elastase inhibitor, cannot suppress the metastasis of lung cancer, in contrast to the multi-targeting natural product EGCG, via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that the direct binding of EGCG to neutrophil elastase and the stimulation of AAT by EGCG are crucial for the inhibition of the neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells by EGCG. However, the molecules and signaling pathways that modulate the expression of AAT remain unclear, and it is important to explore the mechanisms that regulate AAT, which is a SERPIN that is highly related to lung inflammation and lung cancer. Additionally, the role of EGCG in the neutrophil elastase-induced induction of tumor metastasis and growth in other xenograft murine models of lung cancer remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that EGCG, an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, modulates the migration of NSCLC A549 cells and blocks the neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells by up-regulating AAT expression.
