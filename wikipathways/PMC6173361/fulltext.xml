They are highly heterogeneous in cell composition, limiting effective therapies. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the proportions of mesenchymal cells including macrophages and microglia can comprise up to 40% of all cells [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Macrophages (MQs) are a major component of the innate immune system [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and their presence in glial tumors suggests they have a role in tumor pathogenesis and may influence the success of treatment [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Due to their relatively high plasticity, MQs can adapt to local microenvironments by differentiating into sub-phenotypes with various functions [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The immune-phenotypes of MQs are, for practical reasons, commonly classified into either the M1 and M2 spectrum [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, it is acknowledged that the strict dichotomy does not reflect the actual immune profile of the cells; there is a gradual transition between M1 and M2 and other subtypes may exist as well. In the microenvironment of malignant tumors, recruited monocytes predominantly differentiate into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), hereby typically exhibiting an M2-like MQ phenotype. M2-like TAMs are characterized by higher expression levels of cell surface markers CD163, CD204, CD206, and CSFR1. In addition, M2-like TAMs secrete higher levels of IL-10, CCL18, TGF-&#x003b2;, and COX-2 [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This paracrine profile mainly induces local immune-suppression by inhibiting infiltration of CD8+ T cells and promoting activation of the regulatory T cells population [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. TAMs also promote tumor angiogenesis via secretion of pro-angiogenic factors and enzymes like VEGFA, VEGFC, PDGFB, PDGFC, uPA, FGF, Cathepsin and MMPs [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In breast, prostate, bladder and cervical cancers, the presence of M2-like TAMs is therefore strongly associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, increased malignancy and poor prognosis [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The number of TAMs is moreover highly correlated with human glioma vascular density [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>A better understanding of the molecular regulators of M2-like TAMs will improve the identification of new drug targets in the treatment of GBM and other types of malignant tumors. In previous studies of diffuse gliomas, we examined the function of cat eye syndrome critical region 1 (CECR1), a conserved molecule that is highly expressed in the macrophage lineage [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. CECR1 reportedly functions as a growth factor and immune regulator through its adenosine deaminase enzymatic activity as well as by direct binding to adenosine receptors in invertebrates and vertebrates [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. More specifically, CECR1 binds to adenosine receptors and functions as a growth factor for monocytes and T lymphocytes via autocrine and paracrine stimulation [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In monocytes, CECR1 has been shown to promote MQ differentiation [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a recent genetic study, loss-of-function mutations in CECR1 were associated with a range of vascular and inflammatory phenotypes in patients with syndromic presentations of early-onset stroke, systemic vasculopathy and auto-inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The cytokine profile of patient-derived CECR1 gene deficient MQs demonstrated a predominant M1-like pro-inflammatory phenotype [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our previous findings reported an increased expression of CECR1 in TAMs of gliomas, and provided causal evidence that CECR1 is vital for promoting TAM differentiation towards a M2-like (immune-suppressive) phenotype [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CECR1 functions as an oncogenic molecule that enhances glioma proliferation, migration and angiogenesis via direct crosstalk between TAMs and glial cells [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Although these studies improved our understanding of CECR1 function in TAMs, the complex intracellular molecular mechanisms in MQs that are mediated by CECR1, remain to be further elucidated. In this study, we aimed to define the function of CECR1 in TAMs by a proteomic approach. We identified key CECR1 regulated molecules and pathways in normal macrophages and TAMs that are activated by glial tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Changes in proteomic profile of THP-1 MQs in response to CECR1 siRNA silencing</title><p>A flow chart of the study design is provided in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. For proteomic analysis, CECR1 was silenced in PMA-treated THP-1 cells (MQs) by siRNA for 96 hours. The efficiency of CECR1 silencing was validated using two separate siRNA approaches; 1) by immunofluorescent visualization of the CECR1 signal in siCECR1 treated MQs compared with non-targeting scrambled siRNA (siSham, Dharmacon) transfected control MQs and 2) by immunofluorescent visualization of the CECR1 signal with a second set of non-overlapping siCECR treated MQs compared to a fluorescently labeled universal negative control (siSham, Sigma Aldrich) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A&#x02013;1D</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of study design and workflow</title><p>Human monocytic THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages (MQs) by PMA stimulation (100 ng/ml) for 48 hours followed by siRNA transfection (CECR1 targeting versus non-targeted scrambled siSham as transfection control, using two different siRNA and scrambled systems).

For more in-depth analysis, proteins that were non-significantly affected by CECR1 siRNA were analyzed together with the 67 upregulated proteins, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).

Results were compared with U87 co-cultured MQs treated with siSham (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In total, 47 proteins were significantly affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>); 18 proteins were upregulated by siCECR1 in co-culture and 29 proteins were downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 3 and 4</xref>). Gene ontology analysis could not identify any curated pathways that were significantly annotated to the 18 upregulated proteins. The majority of pathways that were significantly linked to the 29 down-regulated proteins were based on four proteasome proteins; PSMC6, PSMA7, PSMA5, and PSMD8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). The most relevant pathways were all primarily involved in cell cycle regulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In line with these findings, the proliferation rate of U87-stimulated siCECR1 MQs was lower than U87-stimulated siSham control MQs, as shown by MTT assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).

In glial tumors, the TAM population mainly exhibits a M2-MQ like phenotype. We previously reported that CECR1 was strongly expressed by M2-like TAMs in high-grade gliomas. In line with the results of the genetic study, CECR1 proved vital for differentiation of monocytes towards M2-like TAMs in a glial tumor paracrine environment by means of U87 conditioned medium stimulation [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. CECR1 activity in M2-like TAMs also promoted paracrine stimulation of glial tumor cell migration and proliferation [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, CECR1 function facilitated paracrine crosstalk of M2-like TAMs with perivascular pericytes, contributing to tumor angiogenesis [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Although these studies provide direct evidence for the significant role of CECR1 in TAM regulation, the molecular mechanisms that drive the CECR1-mediated function of TAMs remains to be elucidated. A genome-wide &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; approach could help reveal CECR1 mechanisms. A previously published genome-wide transcriptome dataset of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from patients with CECR1 mutations, showed marked increased expression of neutrophil-associated genes in disease condition [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Another case-report study did not detect upregulation of neutrophil-associated genes in the patient&#x02019;s PBMCs, but demonstrated an increase in IFN-&#x003b3; response genes [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In line with this report, patients with CECR1 genetic mutations that received anti-TNF-&#x003b1; antibody treatment reached complete remission or partially recovered from their autoimmune disease-like symptoms [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The latter clearly demonstrates the potential value of in depth analysis of CECR1 mediated mechanisms in identifying new drug targets for therapy development. As most molecular data on CECR1 function in immune cells were obtained from the mixed PBMC population, these findings remain difficult to extrapolate to aid in our understanding of the CECR1 working mechanism of local TAMs in glial tumors. The general working mechanism of CECR1 in monocytes/macrophages also requires further exploration.</p><p>In this study, we conducted proteomic analysis of siRNA mediated CECR1 silencing in THP-1-derived MQs that were stimulated with or without glial tumor cells (U87) in co-culture. We validated siCECR1 efficiency and selectivity by employing 2 separate siRNA systems. As a second validation, we confirmed increased RNA expression of the 5 targets with the highest fold change found in the proteomics analysis (MQ siCECR1 vs. MQ siSham), using the siCECR1 system from Sigma Aldrich.</p><p>In the absence of U87 stimulation, siCECR1 in MQs showed a protein profile related to key immune response regulation mechanisms in MQ, including &#x0201c;MHC I antigen presenting&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Phagosome maturation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Caveolin mediated endocytosis&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Type I interferon signaling pathway&#x0201d;. These pathways are mostly involved in pro-inflammatory responses and anti-pathogen defense, and are more in line with M1-macrophage function. Among these three pathways, &#x0201c;MHC I Antigen Presenting&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Phagosome maturation&#x0201d; are also regulated via IFN-&#x003b3; signaling [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; has been recognized as the main cytokine that is associated to induction of the M1 response [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our data showed upregulation of proteins mapping into interferon responding pathway in response to siCECR-1 of MQs, including ISG15, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP, and TIMP-1. Furthermore, several proteins that were recently reported to be involved in immune response like WDFY1 and SEPT7, involved in phagosome assembly and vesicle transport [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], were also enriched in CECR1-silenced MQs. WDFY1 is an adaptor protein anchored on the membrane of early endosomes. It participates in Toll like receptor pathways and activates NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway in MQs, which in turn, activates the transcription of type I interferons. Other activated inflammatory factors include key proteins of the M1 macrophage cytokine release repertoire such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CXCL10 [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, siCECR1 in MQs promotes higher levels of proteins associated with the MHC I antigen presenting function. This would imply enhanced CD8+ T cell activation, a feature that is associated with M1-macrophages [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, in line with present literature and our previous studies, current data shows that CECR1 function in MQs is indeed important to endorse M2 macrophage function, made evident by the shift towards a more M1 macrophage-like proteosome profile observed in response to siCECR1 treatment.</p><p>Malignant tumors such as glial tumors are known to influence the local immune response, including hampering vital MQ functions like antigen presenting and phagocytosis [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, we observed a general inhibitory effect of U87 cell on the CECR1-silencing response in MQs: co-culture with U87 cells reversed the siCECR1 induced pro-inflammatory M1-like protein profile in MQs. No upregulation of proteins involved in the &#x0201c;MHC I antigen presenting&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Phagosome maturation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Caveolin mediated endocytosis&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Type I interferon signaling pathway&#x0201d; were observed. In contrast, siCECR1 in MQs under U87 co-culture mainly downregulated proteins part of the cell cycle regulation. In line with this proteome profile, siCECR1 MQs in U87 co-culture indeed showed a lower proliferation capacity compared to siSham treated controls. MQ proliferation was reportedly activated by paracrine stimulation of malignant tumor cells, mainly via secretion of various cytokines and growth factors like M-CSF [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Numerous studies have indicated that reduction of the number of immuno-suppressive (M2) MQs could be an effective anti-tumor therapeutic approach [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our proteomic analysis revealed downregulation of the proteasome proteins PSMA5, PSMA7, PSMC6 and PSMD8 in siCECR1 U87 co-culture conditions. PSMA5 and PSMA7 are essential subunits of the complete assembly of the 20S proteasome core complex, whereas PSMC6 and PSMD8 are essential subunits of the 19S regulatory particle. Together, 1 20S core and 2 19S regulator particles form the functional 26S proteasome complex [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The 26-proteasome complex participates in various critical cell pathways including DNA synthesis, repair, transcription, translation and cell signal transduction [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] as well as antigen presentation [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and regulation of cell cycle transition [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Cell proliferation and the cell cycle are mainly regulated by 26S proteasomes by targeting p53 [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and inhibitors of cell cycle dependent kinase, like p21 [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], p27 [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Inhibition of 26S proteasome activity led to cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis by increasing levels of p53, p21 and p27 [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our findings indicate that CECR1 silencing may contribute to low proliferation rate of TAMs via downregulation of essential protein components of the S26 proteasome complex. Thus, CECR1 depletion may be considered as a novel approach in targeting TAM proliferation in gliomas.</p><p>Overlap analysis of our data identified S100A9 and PLAU as two CECR1-related proteins that are significantly correlated with expression of CECR1 and MQ lineage markers in GBMs. These two molecules are highly expressed in myeloid cells [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. S100A9 was also shown to promote glioma growth and angiogenesis by interaction with the RAGE receptor on the surface of glioma cells [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], a process mediated via activation of MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. PLAU is one of the pro-angiogenic factors that can be produced by TAMs [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It was shown to aid the invasion and metastasis of various types of cancer cells via binding to PLAUR, subsequently activating downstream pathways like ERK1/2 [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and PI3K/Akt [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, the interaction of PLAU-PLAUR raised plasmin levels, contributing to the activation of matrix metalloproteinases [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>In U87 co-cultured MQs, siCECR1 upregulated protein levels of LAT2. Coincidently, U87 co-culture decreased the LAT2 expression in siSham MQs. Previous studies pointed to an immune modulatory function of LAT2 via competing with TREM-2/LAT signaling pathway, which resulted in upregulation of IL-12 and downregulation of IL-10 in LPS stimulated MQs [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Indeed, siCECR1 MQs in U87 co-culture conditions displayed a decrease in their IL-10/IL-12p35 ratio.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study we have identified, for the first time to our knowledge, the molecular pathways and key molecules that are mediated by CECR1 function in MQs and glial TAMs. Our proteome dataset could provide the basis for the development of interesting drug targets for future immunotherapy development in the treatment of malignant (glial) tumors as well as auto immune disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell cultures</title><p>The human monocytic cell line, THP-1 cells were obtained from the department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam.

Significantly expressed proteins were enriched in Gene Ontology (GO), biological process pathways and KEGG pathways by using STRING database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://string-db.org/">http://string-db.org/</ext-link>). For validating pathways explored in Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway database, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, USA) was applied. For network visualization, firstly, proteins that were not significantly changed were imported as background molecules and mapped into canonical pathways together with significantly expressed proteins. Proteins mapped into Canonical Pathways (FDR &#x0003c; 0.05) were exported, and networks were generated by STRING online software. Information of each network were exported and visualized using Cytoscape 3.3.</p><p>Mutual expressed proteins were identified and visualized by Venny Graphs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/">http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/</ext-link>).
