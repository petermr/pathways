We reported the role of a novel 3p26.3 tumor suppressor gene (TSG) <italic>CHL1</italic> in NPC. Down-regulation of <italic>CHL1</italic> was detected in 4/6 of NPC cell lines and 71/95 (74.7%) in clinical tissues. Ectopic expressions of CHL1 in NPC cells significantly inhibit colony formation and cell motility in functional study. By up-regulating epithelial markers and down-regulating mesenchymal markers <italic>CHL1</italic> could induce mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), a key step in preventing tumor invasion and metastasis. <italic>CHL1</italic> could also cause the inactivation of RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42 signaling pathway and inhibit the formation of stress fiber, lamellipodia, and filopodia. <italic>CHL1</italic> could co-localize with adhesion molecule Integrin-&#x003b2;1, the expression of <italic>CHL1</italic> was positively correlated with Integrin-&#x003b2;1 and another known tumor suppressor gene (TSG) Merlin. Down-regulation of Integrin-&#x003b2;1 or Merlin was significantly correlated with the poor survival rate of NPC patients. Further mechanistic studies showed that <italic>CHL1</italic> could directly interact with integrin-&#x003b2;1 and link to Merlin, leading to the inactivation of integrin &#x003b2;1-AKT pathway. In conclusion, <italic>CHL1</italic> is a vital tumor suppressor in the carcinogenesis of NPC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nasopharyngeal carcinoma</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor gene</kwd><kwd>tumor invasion</kwd><kwd>tumor metastasis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a widespread head and neck malignancy that poses a serious threat to health especially in Southeast Asia <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Although the molecular mechanism underlying the development of NPC remains unclear, some factors such as genetic susceptibility, EBV infection and environmental risk have been associated with its pathogenesis <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Cytogenetic studies have been able detect multiple recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in NPC including the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3p, suggesting that the resident genes at this region play important roles in NPC pathogenesis <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Studies has showed that the loss of chromosome 3p was recurrently observed in several carcinogenic disease including NPC <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, lung cancer <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and esophageal carcinomas <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> . By using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-mass array, we identified the corresponding tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) commonly deleted at 3p in non-small cell lung cancer <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and esophageal squamous cell cancer <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. A putative TSG called cell close homologue of L1 (<italic>CHL1</italic>, also known as <italic>CALL</italic>) located at 3p26 loci was identified because it is commonly deleted in lung, esophageal and nasopharyngeal carcinoma respectively.</p><p><italic>CHL1</italic> encodes a protein with 1,224 amino acids belonging to a member of the L1 gene family of neural cell adhesion molecules (CAM) <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. CHL1 protein contains a single-pass transmembrane peptide, 6 immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, 4 fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, and a 105-amino acid cytoplasmic domain <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Being a neurotransmitter, <italic>CHL1</italic> has been reported to be involved in the general cognitive activities <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. It is also reported to be involved in some neurological diseases such as schizophrenia <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Deleting a copy of this gene may be associated with mental dysfunction of 3p- syndrome <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. As a CAM member, <italic>CHL1</italic> and <italic>L1CAM</italic> another CAM have been reported in cancer development and metastasis in ovarian <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, breast <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, colon <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, pancreatic <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and gallbladder <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> cancers. A study has also reported that 3p26 is a major predisposition locus for prostate cancer <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Collectively these findings suggest that <italic>CHL1</italic> is involved in the carcinogenesis.

(Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">1</xref>B). Clinical correlation study also showed that the down-regulation of <italic>CHL1</italic> was not significantly associated with any tested clinical features (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">1</xref>). In the paired tumor and non-tumor tissue, down-regulation of <italic>CHL1</italic> was detected in 12/15 (80.0%) of the NPC cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The chart showed a significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) in the levels of <italic>CHL1</italic> between NPC and paired non-tumor tissues. We also investigated the mechanism of expression of <italic>CHL1</italic> using qPCR and western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C) in 3 NPC cell lines (C666, SUNE1 and CNE2) and 2 immortalized nasopharyngeal (NP) cell lines (NP69 and NP460). The result revealed that down-regulation of <italic>CHL1</italic> was observed in 4 cell lines (NP69, C666, SUNE1 and CNE2), except NP460. To explore the mechanism behind <italic>CHL1</italic> down-regulation, promoter methylation status of <italic>CHL1</italic> in NP460, SUNE1 and CNE2 were characterized by BGS.

In order to test this hypothesis, Western blot analysis was performed to compare the expression of EMT markers between <italic>CHL1</italic>- transfected and non-transfected cells.

F-actin staining revealed that more stress fiber, lamellipodia and filopodia was observed in non-transfected cells, compared to <italic>CHL1</italic>-transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D), which suggests the migratory phenotype inhibited by <italic>CHL1</italic> may be associated with Rho-GTPases activity. To test this hypothesis, pull-down assay was used to compare the amount of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 (total and GTP-bound active form) between <italic>CHL1</italic>- transfected and non-transfected cells. Despite having similar level of total RhoA and Rac1in <italic>CHL1</italic>- transfected and non-transfected cells, the pulled down active forms of RhoA-GTP and Rac1-GTP were dramatically decreased in <italic>CHL1</italic>-transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D).

Human Merlin encoded by NF2 is a magic molecule that functions as a linker to actin-cytoskeleton <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. To study the relationship of these proteins, qPCR was performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). Additionally, Western blot was also used to analyze the expression of Integrin &#x003b2;1 in NPC cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). The mRNA levels of these three proteins were investigated by qPCR using non-paired clinical NPC tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). A significant positive correlation was observed between <italic>CHL1</italic> and Integrin &#x003b2;1 in paired and non-paired clinical tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E). Furthermore, the box plot showed that NPC tumors differed significantly from their paired tumor samples in the mean expression level of Integrin &#x003b2;1 (P=0.0006; Supplementary 1E &#x00026; 1F). It was observed that the expressive tendency of Integrin &#x003b2;1 is the same with <italic>CHL1</italic> in the clinical samples. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the down-regulation of Integrin &#x003b2;1 and Merlin was not correlated with Disease-Free Survival (DFS) time (P &#x0003e;0.05) in NPC patients, but results after 30 months of observation was different, as shown in the diagram (Supplementary 1C and Supplementary 1D).

The result revealed that <italic>CHL1</italic> and Integrin &#x003b2;1 were co-localized on the cell membrane. To confirm the interaction of <italic>CHL1</italic> and Integrin &#x003b2;1, we conducted a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. The result showed that Integrin &#x003b2;1 and Merlin could be pulled down by <italic>CHL1</italic> and vice versa, suggesting an interaction between the two proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>I).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>CHL1</italic> inhibits Integrin &#x003b2;1-mediated activation of Akt signaling</title><p>To investigate how <italic>CHL1</italic> affect Integrin &#x003b2;1-mediated Akt signaling pathway, western blot was performed.

In this study, down-regulation of <italic>CHL1</italic> was frequently detected in NPCs at transcriptional level, suggesting that this gene plays a crucial role in NPC carcinogenesis. The tumor-suppressive function of <italic>CHL1</italic> was characterized in two NPC cell lines (SUNE1 and C666).</p><p>In all the NPC cell lines tested in which <italic>CHL1</italic> was not expressed or poorly expressed, frequent methylation promoters were discovered, showing that methylation is a potential mechanism for silencing <italic>CHL1.</italic> The expression of <italic>CHL1</italic> was restored after demethylation with 5'Aza. Both <italic>in vitro</italic> (cell growth rate and foci formation) and<italic> in vivo</italic> (tumor formation in nude mouse) assays showed that <italic>CHL1</italic> has a potent inhibitory effect on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.</p><p>Molecular analysis revealed that the tumor-suppressive effect of <italic>CHL1</italic> regulates cell cycle arrest at G1/S checkpoint by down-regulating cyclin D1, which is accumulating before S-phase and reaching its maximum. This process favors the movement of cells to the S-phase, making cyclin D1 a critical target of proliferative signals in G1. These results indicate that <italic>CHL1</italic> could be required at G1/S transition in NPC cells.</p><p><italic>CHL1</italic> also showed strong inhibitory effects on cell motility, invasion and epithelial- mesenchymal transition. In the transition phase several of the epithelial markers were increased in the same process several mesenchymal markers were decrease in<italic> CHL1</italic> transfected cells compared to non-transfected cells, which indicates the negative role of <italic>CHL1</italic> in EMT. Also, it was revealed that <italic>CHL1</italic> could disrupt F-actin formation by inactivation of Rac1/Cdc42, which is an important regulator in the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia.</p><p>During tumor initiation, invasion and metastasis, the activity of Rho GTPase would affect the construction of actin cytoskeleton and the interaction of adherent junctions in cytoskeleton <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. The activities of RhoA, Rac and Cdc42 have been well defined in regulating the actin cytoskeleton <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Activation of RhoA could induce formation of stress fibers, Rac1 could induce lamellipodium, while Cdc42 could induce filopodia <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement promotes progression and metastasis of cancer by crossing the basement membrane and easily reaching distant organs. Therefore, we proposed that the down-regulation of <italic>CHL1</italic> plays a vital role in NPC invasion and metastasis. Both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays supported the hypothesis and these findings strongly suggest that the function of <italic>CHL1</italic> could inhibit both cancer progression and metastasis.</p><p>Integrins are transmembrane &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit comprising transmembrane receptors essential for the development and survival of organisms <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Although the role of Integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions in metastasis had been recognized, Integrin &#x003b2;1 can also act as critical receptor for a well-known oncoprotein <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. As a transmembrane glycoprotein, it could interact with <italic>CHL1-</italic> the integrin recognition sequence (SFT) on cell surfaces <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. As suggested by immunofluorescence assay, Integrin &#x003b2;1 overlaps with <italic>CHL1</italic> on the cell surface. The expressive tendency of Integrin &#x003b2;1 is the same with <italic>CHL1</italic>. In addition, the box plot demonstrated a significant difference in the expression level of integrin &#x003b2;1 between the nasopharyngeal carcinoma and non-tumor tissues, with a significant positive correlation observed between these two proteins.</p><p>Integrins activate FAK and trigger the fast recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins like talin and paxillin to its cytoplasmic domains <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Co-localized FAK, paxillin, integrins, tailin were found in the layer of the cell surface<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Talin is a highly molecular cytoskeleton protein, which is mainly concentrated in the lower cell contact area <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and at the cell-cell contacts of lymphocytes. It can directly or indirectly link integrin to the actin skeleton through interaction with NYC and alpha actin <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that integrin is associated with talus, although the affinity was low <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Talin also binds to vinculin, another cytoskeletal protein associated with cell adhesion. Talin has a large C-terminal domain containing alpha helices which binds to actin and an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1,ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domain with three subdomains: F1, F2, and F3<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>-<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>.

The ERM-NF2 protein has a conserved structure, an amino acid terminal domain, an extended alpha helix region and an actin binding carboxy terminal (C) region <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. The FERM domain pocket is the competitive site of the C- terminal self-binding region of ERM protein, and this head to tail interaction leads to "closed" monomer or in dimers. When in closed conformation the biding sites for FERM ligands and the actin is blocked, the inactive ERM is most likely confined in the cytoplasm <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. During the phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal Thr residue <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, the ERM proteins are in the open conformation, which could link plasma membrane proteins to the actin cyto skeleton<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. While in contrast an overlapping view is observed condition when it binds to Merlin.</p><p>Human Merlin encoded by NF2 is a magic molecule that functions as a linker to actin-cytoskeleton <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and as a tumor suppressor in many brain cancers, including schwannomas <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, meningioma<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>-<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, and ependymomas <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>. By using the pull-down assay the relationship between <italic>CHL1</italic>, Integrin-&#x003b2;1, and Merlin has been demonstrated. When <italic>CHL1</italic> is lost, integrin beta1-AKT pathway would be activated by phosphorylation and inactivation of Merlin, so that <italic>CHL1</italic> it no longer plays its tumor suppressive role (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this study reveals <italic>CHL1</italic> as a tumor suppressor gene for both nasopharyngeal carcinoma progression and metastasis. <italic>CHL1</italic> plays this role through a mechanism involving the interaction of Integrin &#x003b2;1 and Merlin, and subsequently the inactivation of a host of downstream signaling cascades, called the PI3K/Akt pathway. In view of the important role of Akt and Merlin in the development of tumor, a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of <italic>CHL1</italic> in nasopharyngeal carcinoma will provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM0"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><caption><p>Supplementary figures and tables.</p></caption><media xlink:href="ijbsv15p1802s1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Immortal nasopharyngeal epithelial cell lines NP69, NP 460 were kindly provided by Prof. George S.
