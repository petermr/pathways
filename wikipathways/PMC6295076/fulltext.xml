Cyclin G2 has been shown to be associated with the development of multiple types of tumors, but its underlying mechanisms in gastric tumors is not well-understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the role and the underlying mechanisms of cyclin G2 on Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and in silico assay were used to determine the expression of cyclin G2 in gastric cancer. TCGA datasets were used to evaluate the association between cyclin G2 expression and the prognostic landscape of gastric cancers. The effects of ectopic and endogenous cyclin G2 on the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells were assessed using the MTS assay, colony formation assay, cell cycle assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay. Moreover, a xenograft model and a metastasis model of nude mice was used to determine the influence of cyclin G2 on gastric tumor growth and migration in vivo. The effects of cyclin G2 expression on Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling were explored using a TOPFlash luciferase reporter assay, and the molecular mechanisms involved were investigated using immunoblots assay, yeast two-hybrid screening, immunoprecipitation and Duolink in situ PLA. <italic>Ccng2</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice were generated to further confirm the inhibitory effect of cyclin G2 on Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in vivo.

Moreover, overexpression of cyclin G2 attenuated tumor growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Dpr1 was identified as a cyclin G2-interacting protein which was required for the cyclin G2-mediated inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin expression. Mechanically, cyclin G2 impacted the&#x000a0;activity of CKI to phosphorylate Dpr1, which has been proved to be a protein that acts as a suppressor of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling when unphosphorylated. Furthermore, GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitors abolished the cyclin G2-induced suppression of cell proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This study demonstrates that cyclin G2 suppresses Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling and inhibits gastric cancer cell growth and migration through Dapper1.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13046-018-0973-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cyclin G2</kwd><kwd>Dpr1</kwd><kwd>Gastric Cancer</kwd><kwd>Tumor suppressor</kwd><kwd>Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81400851</award-id><award-id>81170543</award-id><award-id>81571440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jinlan</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Foundation of Liaoning Educational Committee</institution></funding-source><award-id>LZDK201703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par28">Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors and is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide according to recent estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Since &#x003b2;-catenin is primed by GSK-3&#x003b2; for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, we next assessed whether GSK-3&#x003b2; was involved in the cyclin G2-induced suppression of the &#x003b2;-catenin expression. No significant alteration in GSK-3&#x003b2; expression was found in cells overexpressing cyclin G2. However, overexpression of cyclin G2 notably reduced the expression of P-Ser9 GSK-3&#x003b2;, the inactive form of GSK-3&#x003b2;, and increased the phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). In addition, the ability of cyclin G2 to promote &#x003b2;-catenin degradation was compromised when GSK-3&#x003b2; activity was inhibited by LiCl (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g). These results demonstrated that the role of cyclin G2 in promoting &#x003b2;-catenin degradation required the induction of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity. Moreover, treatment of cyclin G2-overexpressing cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor that inhibits the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in mammalian cells, did not change the &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels while &#x003b2;-catenin expression was decreased by cyclin G2 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treated group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h). These results indicated that cyclin G2 promoted &#x003b2;-catenin degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system.

We used wild-type cyclin G2 as a yeast two-hybrid bait to screen the human fetal brain library. One of the positive clones encoded full-length hDpr1, an inhibitor of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. The interaction between cyclin G2 and Dpr1 at endogenous levels in HEK-293 cells was confirmed using the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Direct interaction between cyclin G2 and Dpr1 was determined using the Duolink in situ PLA in fixed COS-7 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Besides, Dvl2 protein, which is suppressed by Dpr1 protein that serves as a negative regulator for both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling, was also detected in the same cyclin G2 immunoprecipitant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a).

We, therefore, determined whether cyclin G2 influenced the stability of Dvl2 protein. COS-7 cells overexpressing cyclin G2 were treated with or without different inhibitors of protein degradation.

Overexpression of cyclin G2 increased the degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin, and inhibited the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin downstream target genes, indicating that the cyclin G2 had a negative effect on the &#x003b2;-catenin function.

In the present study, we first determined the expression of cyclin G2 in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Low mRNA and protein expression of cyclin G2 in gastric cancer indicated that cyclin G2 is involved in the progression of gastric cancers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This result is in accordance with previous studies in which low expression of cyclin G2 was observed in gastric cancers compared with normal gastric tissue. We also checked 5 online datasets(334 cases), the mRNA expression profiles of cyclin G2 among five oncomine datasets are not consistent (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Figure S1). Previously, we reported that cyclin G2 inhibited the osteogenesis of murine myoblast C2C12 cells through the canonical Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; this suggested that cyclin G2 may play a role in other types of cells, including cancer cells. Indeed, another study demonstrated that cyclin G2 inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by disrupting the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in epithelial ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Our findings that cyclin G2 suppressed &#x003b2;-catenin expression and TOP/FOP luciferase activities in gastric cancer cells, as well as in HeLa, HT-29, HEK293 and COS-7 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and c), strongly provide evidence that cyclin G2 acts as a suppressor of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Additionally, Chir99021 abolished the cyclin G2-induced inhibition on SGC-7901 cells proliferation and migration in vitro (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d and e), suggesting that cyclin G2 inhibited gastric cancer through the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Besides SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cell lines, we performed a series of experiments to determine the effect of overexpressing cyclin G2 in AGS cells, which is a commonly used gastric cancer cell line, using cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay and transwell assay.
