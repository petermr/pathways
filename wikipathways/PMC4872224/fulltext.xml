In the present study, the bioinformatical analysis of the transcriptomic data from oyster <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> and further biological validation revealed that oyster TNF (CgTNF-1 CGI_10018786) could activate the transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B and HSF (heat shock transcription factor) through MAPK signaling pathway, and then regulate apoptosis, redox reaction, neuro-regulation and protein folding in oyster haemocytes. The activated immune cells then released neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, norepinephrine and [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin to regulate the immune response by arising the expression of three TNF (CGI_10005109, CGI_10005110 and CGI_10006440) and translocating two NF-&#x003ba;B (Cgp65, CGI_10018142 and CgRel, CGI_10021567) between the cytoplasm and nuclei of haemocytes. Neurotransmitters exhibited the immunomodulation effects by influencing apoptosis and phagocytosis of oyster haemocytes. Acetylcholine and norepinephrine could down-regulate the immune response, while [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin up-regulate the immune response. These results suggested that the simple neuroendocrine-immune regulatory network in oyster might be activated by oyster TNF and then regulate the immune response by virtue of neurotransmitters, cytokines and transcription factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The neuroendocrine-immune (NEI) regulatory network consists of nervous system, endocrine system and immune system, which carries a reciprocal regulation to maintain homeostasis in the host with the involvement of signaling molecules, such as neurotransmitters, hormones and cytokines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The accumulating evidences in the last decades have clearly documented the vital importance of NEI network in the regulation of physiological homeostatic mechanisms, in particular with regard to immunomodulation functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>The structure and function of the NEI regulatory network in vertebrates have been well understood, and the connections between neuroendocrine system and immune system are mediated by nerve pathways, hormonal circuits, cytokines, neuropeptides and chemokines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The central nervous system (CNS) mediates both innate and adaptive immunity through systemic, regional and local routes. The peripheral nervous system provides the first line of defense at local sites, while the sympathetic (or adrenergic) nervous system (SNS), and the parasympathetic (or cholinergic) nervous system generally inhibit inflammation at a regional level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Once the host is invaded by pathogenic microorganisms, the immune system will be activated immediately by immune surveillance cells, and then generate immune mediators to activate peripheral sensory afferent neurons. The activated neurons release neurotransmitters, such as neuropeptides, to up-regulate the immune response level and transfer the immune signals to the CNS at the same time. When the immune response exceeds a certain threshold or the pathogens are completely removed, the CNS releases immune mediators such as glucocorticoids, acetylcholine and catecholamines by controlling adrenal or autonomic nervous system to suppress immune response in case of an immune injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Meanwhile, energy is re-allocated in the above processes to maintain the immune response and homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. There are various kinds of neuroendocrine-immune axes and neuroendocrine cells in mammals to impinge on neuro-immunomodulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Analogous NEI network has also been found in invertebrates. The structure of nervous system in invertebrates is relatively simple, and its diversity and complexity increases along with the evolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. A primitive nervous system consisting of two neurons exists in the most primitive multicellular organisms sponges, and there is neither synaptic contacts nor motion-control functions between neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In Cnidaria, neurons contact with each other through synapses within a reticular nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, while there is a trapezoidal nervous system in Platyhelminthes, indicating a dramatic progress in evolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. A chain nervous system consisting of pharyngeal ganglia and abdominal ganglia occurs in Annelida and Arthropoda, dominating contractile activity of muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Molluscs have the well-developed nervous system in invertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> with the presence of cephalic ganglia, pleural ganglia, visceral ganglia and pedal ganglia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. For example, the nervous system of oyster <italic>Crassostrea virginica</italic> consists of two cerebral ganglia (CG) under the palps, and one visceral ganglia (VG) near the posterior adductor muscle with the nerve fibers connecting them<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Although the nervous systems vary dramatically in structure, a growing number of ancestral molecules have been found in invertebrates sharing similar roles in the immune regulation of vertebrates, which makes it believable that hormonal and neuronal immune-regulating routes do exist in invertebrates. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), biogenic Amine (BA), glucocorticoid (GC), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cytokines are considered as basic components of the immunomodulation in invertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, while [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin (ENK), acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NE) are present in an extensive range of the phylum. However, the knowledge about the activation mechanism of neuroendocrine system and its regulation in the invertebrate immune response is still very limited.</p><p>The molluscs have evolved a primitive neuroendocrine system and a sophisticated immune system, which are more complex and important than what we have learned<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In the previous studies, catecholaminergic and cholinergic system, [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin and its receptor, as well as cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were reported to be existed in scallop <italic>C. farreri</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and oyster <italic>C. gigas</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, which opened up new horizons and provided us an entrance to a better understanding of the neuroendocrine-immune regulatory network in invertebrates. The information of the NEI regulatory network in mollusc will contribute to the understanding of the NEI system evolution, and also throw light on the study of adaptation of invertebrates to the environment. The purposes of this study are to (1) identify the molecular components of NEI regulatory network in oyster <italic>C. gigas</italic>, (2) explore the potential activation mechanism of neuroendocrine system, (3) investigate the immunomodulation of neurotransmitter acetylcholine, norepinephrine and [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin, and (4) evaluate the synergic effects of neurotransmitters on oyster immune system.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The output of RNA-Seq sequencing</title><p>Sixteen transcriptome fragment libraries were constructed with RiboMinus RNA from oyster haemocytes in eight groups, and each group had two parallel libraries.

Several cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN, have been reported to regulate the release of pituitary hormones by an action on the hypothalamus and/or the pituitary gland in vertebrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. It has been reported that the hormone secretion will alternate when the host is infected, and cytokines may play roles in these alterations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In the present transcriptome analysis, the NEI system in oyster could be quickly activated by tumor necrosis factor (CgTNF-1). After CgTNF-1 treatment, two MAPK pathway-related genes, one NF-&#x003ba;B gene and one HSF gene were observed to be differentially expressed. In addition, two apoptosis-related genes, four redox system-related genes, four neural genes and three molecular chaperone-related genes were also sorted out as differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, a regulatory network predominated by CgTNF-1 was established, in which CgTNF-1 might trigger transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B and HSF through the activation of MAPK signal pathway, and then regulate the apoptosis, redox reaction, neuro-regulation and protein folding in oyster haemocytes. It was suspected that the oyster neuron was activated by CgTNF-1, and the activated neurons would release neurotransmitters to modulate oyster haemocyte through the MAPK pathway. Moreover, in the co-expression network, four genes (CGI_10005110, CGI_10017654, CGI_10018951 and CGI_10024309) and other five genes (CGI_10006440, CGI_10005825, 100023787, CGI_10023156 and CGI_10027979) in the turquoise module formed a network with TNF (CGI_10006440) as the hubgene. And the two networks separately taking TNF gene (CGI_10005110 and CGI_10006440) as hubgenes joined together. It indicated that oyster TNF could activate the immune system with the involvement of NF-&#x003ba;B family, which was similar to that in vertebrates. Although the precise mechanism of this activation is still unclear, a signaling pathway mediated by TNF and NF-&#x003ba;B seems to be the dominant way of oyster neuroendocrine system to trigger the immune response. The present results suggested that oyster TNF might share similar mechanism with vertebrate TNF to initiate immune response through MAPK signaling pathway, and then probably modulate the expression of hundreds of immune-related genes.</p><p>After the immune system is activated, the immune cells will release cytokines to activate some signaling pathways and subsequently regulate the synthesis and secretion of different neurotransmitters including dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and enkephalin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.

In the present study, three typical neurotransmitters, acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE) and [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin (ENK), were employed in the stimulation experiment, and the expressional alternations of immune-related genes were recorded by RNA-seq technique. The mRNA expression levels of CGI_10005109 in LPS_ACh and LPS_NE_ENK groups increased significantly, while those of CGI_10005110 and CGI_10006440 increased dramatically in LPS_ACh group and LPS_ENK group, respectively. The higher expression level of these three TNFs might be partly due to the requirements of their participations in the immune regulation by neurotransmitters. These results indicated that the TNF family was not only the key molecules to activate the immune system, but also vital components of the signaling pathway for the neurotransmitter to modulate the endocrine system of oyster.</p><p>In vertebrates, TNF can bind to TNF receptors (TNFRs) expressed on both glia and neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

In the present study, the mRNA transcript of TNF after neurotransmitter stimulation was detected by quantitative real-time PCR to further understand the possible regulation of neurotransmitters on immune system in oysters. When the neuroendocrine-immune system of oyster was activated by TNF (CGI_10018786) through MAPK signaling pathway with the involvement of NF-&#x003ba;B (Cgp65 and CgRel), the activated neurons and immune cells released neurotransmitters, neuromediators and neuromodulators to regulate the immune system by promoting the mRNA expression level of TNF (CGI_10005109, CGI_10005110 and CGI_10006440) in the haemocytes. The expression levels of CGI_10005109 and CGI_10005110 increased significantly in LPS_ACh group, while CGI_10005109 was significantly overexpressed in the LPS_NE_ENK group. In addition, the expression level of another oyster TNF CGI_10006440 was dramatically increased in the LPS_ENK group. It is reported that neurotransmitters accomplish immunomodulation with the involvement of transcription factors. In the present study, the concentration differences of Cgp65 and CgRel between the cytoplasm and the nuclei reflexed the translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B molecules from cytoplasm into the nucleus, where they bound to immune-related sequences of DNA and then recruited other proteins such as coactivators and RNA polymerase to initiate the transcription and finally resulted in a change of cell function. In the neurotransmitters stimulation groups, the concentration of Cgp65 in nuclei was lower than that in the cytoplasm, indicating that neurotransmitters could regulate immune response by inhibiting the transcription mediated by Cgp65. On the opposite, there was no significant change of CgRel concentration in other groups. The above results suggested that the TNF family could activate the neuroendocrine system, and participate in the immunomodulation of the neurotransmitters.</p><p>After immune stimulation, the neuroendocrine system releases hormones, neurotransmitters and neuromediators to modulate the behavior of immunocytes, which can recognize and eliminate the invaders such as bacteria, viruses, <italic>etc</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Apoptosis is an important mechanism for the adequate clearance of infected, damaged and exhausted cells, especially when the hosts suffer from infection or dissemination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Phagocytosis is an indispensable cellular mechanism to recognize and ingest non-self molecules and cell debris. It includes the process of phagocytic receptor recognition and the signaling pathway activation, which would lead to the dramatic changes in the dynamics of plasma membrane and cytoskeleton. Previous studies have suggested that phagocytosis could be influenced by neuropeptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In the present study, the apoptosis index and the phagocytosis rate were assayed with flow cytometry after the oysters were treated by acetylcholine, norepinephrine and [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin. The apoptosis index of oyster haemocytes in the groups of LPS_ACh (11.43%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and LPS_NE (9.17%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) both decreased significantly after stimulation, while it increased in the LPS_ENK (16.53%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) group. The phagocytosis rate of oyster haemocytes was similar to the apoptosis index, except that the haemocytes phagocytosis rate in the LPS_NE (10.20%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05) group did not change significantly compared with that in PBS and LPS group after neurotransmitter stimulation. The results indicated that acetylcholine and norepinephrine tended to down-regulate the cellular immune response, while [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin up-regulated the cellular immune response of oysters. It was suspected that different types of neurotransmitters could regulate the immune system in different ways, resulting in either up-regulation or down-regulation of the immune response.</p><p>The neuroendocrine-immune regulatory network functions through an extremely complicated mechanism, and the interactions among different neurotransmitters could induce various immune responses and diseases. For example, the imbalance between cholinergic activity and dopaminergic activity in the striatum causes a variety of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Understanding the mechanisms of the synergistic regulation of different neurotransmitters may offer us some indications about the real biological process. In the present study, only one TNF (CGI_10005109) was up-regulated when the oyster was co-treated with norepinephrine and [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin, indicating that there might be some other molecules involved in the regulation of the immune response under the co-stimulation of neurotransmitters. In both LPS_ACh_ENK and LPS_NE_ENK groups, the concentration of Cgp65 in cytoplasm was significantly lower than that in the nuclei, indicating a translocation of Cgp65 from the cytoplasm into the nuclei after co-stimulation of ACh_ENK or NE_ENK. However, CgRel was transferred oppositely from the nuclei into the cytoplasm after co-stimulation. The above results indicated that the transcription regulation induced by co-stimulation of neurotransmitters was likely mediated mainly by transcription factor Cgp65. Furthermore, the apoptosis index and the phagocytosis rate were assayed with flow cytometry to investigate the synergistic physiologican effects of neurotransmitters. It has been reported that [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin can significantly up-regulate haemocyte phagocytosis rate and apoptosis index, while norepinephrine is able to modulate haemocyte ROS level and phagocytosis via &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor in oyster <italic>C. gigas</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. In the present study, both apoptosis index and phagocytosis rate of oyster haemocytes decreased significantly when acetylcholine and norepinephrine were separately injected into oysters together with [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin, suggesting that the activity of [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin to up-regulate the immune response could be overwhelmed by the down-regulation effects of acetylcholine and norepinephrine. These results collectively suggested that there might exist a primitive synergistic neuroendocrine-immune regulatory network in oyster, in which the immune cells were more sensitive to acetylcholine and norepinephrine than [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin.</p><p>The activation and immunomodulation are two major processes of neuroendocrine-immune regulatory network during the immune response of oyster. In conclusion, the neuroendocrine system of oyster could be activated by CgTNF-1 through MAPK signaling pathway with the involvement of NF-&#x003ba;B and HSP. Oyster neurons might be activated and then release neurotransmitters to modulate the immune response by promoting the expression of TNF and translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B in cytoplasm and nuclei of haemocytes. The results provided insights into mechanisms of neuroendocrine-immune regulatory network in oysters and highlighted oysters as the potential model for addressing the evolutionary implications of neuroendocrine-immune system.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Oysters, TNF protein and neurotransmitter treatment</title><p>Oysters <italic>C. gigas</italic> with averagely 110&#x02009;mm in shell height were collected from a local farm in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, and maintained in the aerated seawater at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for two weeks before processing.</p><p>Two hundred and eighty oysters were employed and averagely divided into eight groups.
